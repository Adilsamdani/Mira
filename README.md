MIRA (MY INTELLIGENT RESPONDING ASSISTANT).
my personal voice  assistant
Mira is an intelligent voice assistant that responds to your voice and responds back with a proper reply.
For Mira google is used as search engine which is mostly dependable.
By using libraries such as PYTTSX3 and SpeechRecognition in PYTHON your voice assistant will take your voice input converts into text and by uses Google and gives you best result.
The code can be easily modified by which you can create or update the Commands.
The project contains libraries such as Os,wikipedia,googleSearch which are used to perform the basic tasks.
And  in thos project I have included "Wolframalpha" a python library which is a Computational Search Engine that gives a Specific answer for the query input rather than a listing all the related websites as result.
